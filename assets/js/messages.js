          Hello! Name's Nour Elhamshary, a software engineer with a variety of
          skills at his toolset. Worked in both back-end and front-end
          development, alongside working in various projects using variety of
          programming languages like Java, C# and C++.
          <br />
          <br />
          Fun fact! This website is made of pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript
          (meaning no frameworks used like Angular or React) and that
          <em>is</em> intentional! I am a firm believer of a simple solution
          being the best solution, and a portfolio website does not need to be
          Ã¼ber-fancy in order to send the point across.
          <br />
          <br />
          Maybe except your name is Nour and you decided to use a fully-vanilla
          Matrix effect just as a nice eye candy. :]
          <br />
          <br />
          My full work experience can be found in the "My CV" button if you
          want, and you can communicate with me through E-mail and LinkedIn in
          the other side of the navigation bar! My GitHub is also available for
          you to check on for some personal projects and/or projects I work as a
          collaborator!
          <br />
          <br />
          Whatever you may do around my website, I hope you have a wonderful
          day! Do check on a button named Felix, you will be happy with that
          decision. :]
